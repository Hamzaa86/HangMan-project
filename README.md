# Description

#### This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using JavaScript. The game allows a player to guess letters in a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or the stick figure is fully drawn (indicating that the player has lost).

## How to open the game

### 1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

### 2. The game will start automatically, displaying the word with blanks and the hangman figure.

### 3.Press the letter keys on your keyboard to guess letters.

### 4.After each incorrect guess, part of the hangman figure will be drawn.

### 5.The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or the hangman figure is fully drawn.

## How to Play

- **A word is chosen randomly from a predefined list.**
- **The word is displayed with blanks representing unguessed letters.**
- **You will be prompted to guess a letter by pressing a key on your keyboard.**
- **If your guess is correct, the corresponding letter is revealed in the word.**
- **If your guess is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.**
- **The game continues until either:**
- **You correctly guess the entire word, or
  The hangman figure is fully drawn, meaning you have lost the game.**
- **After each game, you'll have the option to restart and try again.**

## Example:

- **Word to guess: \_ \_ \_ \_ \_**
- **Incorrect guesses: ['X', 'Z']**
- **Current word: _ a _ \_ \_ (assuming 'a' was guessed correctly)**
